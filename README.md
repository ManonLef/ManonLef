## 2025 Update

I started my first developer job as a paid intern in November 2023 and they hired me shortly after! I started there with creating my own full stack feature, a custom dashboard. This was my first back end experience. It was also my first time using .NET, C#, SQL, Angular and TS. Once I got hired, I got my own ongoing project, a WPF based POS system. 

## About Me

I've been a commercial pilot and aviation instructor during most of my working years. Now that I am not flying airplanes anymore I have decided to change into an equally fulfilling career. I feel passionate about tech and programming and am absolutely thrilled I found that new passion.

Next to my programming career, I am still running my own business(es) on the side. One is in type, design, print, and illustration and the other is aviation consultancy and teaching.

During my programming journey, I try to help out fellow learners as I can, either through Discord, or by contributing to open-source projects aimed at teaching. In June 2023 I became part of the maintainer team for [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) and I am excited to be able to contribute to such an amazing resource alongside professionals and fellow contributors in the field.

## The Odin Project projects

I've learned my programming foundations through [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum) which is aimed at full stack development and instilling the programmer mindset, honing problem-solving skills and mainly building things on your own, from scratch, utilizing the documentation and your own research. 

Some of the TOP Projects I've worked on:

- Latest: [A shopping cart React project](https://github.com/ManonLef/tdd-e-commerce) built using Vite and React, testing with RTL and Vitest
- [HeartStone themed memory game](https://github.com/ManonLef/memory-card) using Vite and React
- [CV Builder app](https://github.com/ManonLef/cv-app) with React
- [Weather App](https://github.com/ManonLef/weather-app): Mainly to get a feel for working with API's and async code
- [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/ManonLef/bst): I'm sharing this one instead of my Knights Travails for I feel like the BST exercise was the most elaborate of the Computer Science projects to figure out.
- [BattleShip](https://github.com/ManonLef/battleship): A project that starts out with writing tests in Jest

### Things that keep me motivated and joyful are (amongst others);
intellectual challenges / learning new things, a good cup of coffee, being able to share knowledge, genuine social connections, finding a captivating game, a good sense of innocent but witty humor, maker tools (our house has a workplace for making all kinds of printed things), purposeful listening to music, exploring new things and locations, flowers.
