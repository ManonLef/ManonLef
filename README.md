## About Me

I've been a commercial pilot and aviation instructor during most of my working years. Now that I am not flying airplanes anymore I decided to look into an equally fulfilling career change. I feel passionate about programming and am absolutely thrilled I found that new passion.

I am still running my own business(es). One is in type, design, print, and illustration and the other is aviation consultancy and teaching. You can however find me writing code and learning new tools mostly daily ever since I've set my mind to becoming a hirable programmer. 

During my programming journey, I try to help out fellow learners as I can either through Discord or by contributing to open-source projects aimed at teaching.  

## Recent Progress

I'm following along with [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum) which is aimed at full stack development and instilling the programmer mindset, honing problem-solving skills and mainly building things on your own, from scratch, utilizing the documentation and your own research. 

Some recent Projects I've worked on:
- [Todo](https://github.com/ManonLef/To-Do-App): This one really was the first big project I did. Lots of code, modules and UI decisions were made
- [Weather App](https://github.com/ManonLef/weather-app): Mainly to get a feel for working with API's and async code
- [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/ManonLef/bst): I'm sharing this one instead of my Knights Travails for I feel like the BST exercise was the most elaborate of the Computer Science projects to figure out.

## Currently Learning

I'm currently learning about TDD. For my testing practice, I'm using Jest.

#### Things that keep me motivated and joyful are (amongst others);
intellectual challenges / learning new things, a good cup of coffee, being able to share knowledge, genuine social connections, finding a captivating game, the smell of fresh rain, a good sense of innocent but witty humor, maker tools (our house has a workplace for making all kinds of printed things), purposeful listening to music, exploring new things and locations, flowers.
