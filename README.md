## Latest update - August 2024

I've been interning for a local company since November 2023 and they hired me in 2024!!! I'm very excited about my first job in a professional dev environment. I started there with creating my own full stack feature, a custom dashboard. This was my first back end experience. Also my first time using .NET, C#, SQL, Angular and TS. I'm currently on a different project, still working with .NET and C# but more geared towards software and now also using XAML.

## About Me

I've been a commercial pilot and aviation instructor during most of my working years. Now that I am not flying airplanes anymore I have decided to look into an equally fulfilling career change. I feel passionate about programming and am absolutely thrilled I found that new passion.

I am still running my own business(es). One is in type, design, print, and illustration and the other is aviation consultancy and teaching. You can however find me writing code and learning new tools mostly daily ever since I've set my mind to becoming a hirable programmer. 

During my programming journey, I try to help out fellow learners as I can, either through Discord, or by contributing to open-source projects aimed at teaching. In June 2023 I became part of the maintainer team for [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) and I am honoured, humbled and excited to be able to contribute to such an amazing resource alongside professionals and fellow contributors in the field.

## Recent Projects

I've learned nearly everything I know about programming through [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum) which is aimed at full stack development and instilling the programmer mindset, honing problem-solving skills and mainly building things on your own, from scratch, utilizing the documentation and your own research. 

Some recent Projects I've worked on:

- Latest: [A shopping cart React project](https://github.com/ManonLef/tdd-e-commerce) built using Vite and React, testing with RTL and Vitest
- [HeartStone themed memory game](https://github.com/ManonLef/memory-card) using Vite and React
- [CV Builder app](https://github.com/ManonLef/cv-app) with React
- [Weather App](https://github.com/ManonLef/weather-app): Mainly to get a feel for working with API's and async code
- [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/ManonLef/bst): I'm sharing this one instead of my Knights Travails for I feel like the BST exercise was the most elaborate of the Computer Science projects to figure out.
- [BattleShip](https://github.com/ManonLef/battleship): A project that starts out with writing tests in Jest

## Currently Working on

Company code, which explains my diminished GH activity. If you see me active here, I'm probably maintaining for The Odin Project or playing with code for getting more comfortable in my current stack.

### Things that keep me motivated and joyful are (amongst others);
intellectual challenges / learning new things, a good cup of coffee, being able to share knowledge, genuine social connections, finding a captivating game, the smell of fresh rain, a good sense of innocent but witty humor, maker tools (our house has a workplace for making all kinds of printed things), purposeful listening to music, exploring new things and locations, flowers.
